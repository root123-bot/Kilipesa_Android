sometimes i build my apk having the some problems caused by the dependencies issues which cause 
in development to install packages by force using '--force' or '--legacy-peer-deps' command but
now i have the solution for this when building apk using 'eas' which also works with 'npm' to 
install all packages to avoid it to fail you should enforce it to run this command of '--force' or 
'--legacy-peer-deps' by adding file of ".npmrc" in the root of your project and add this line to it
"legacy-peer-deps=true"

You should give the credit to this guys from the github...
